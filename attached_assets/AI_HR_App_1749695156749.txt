# TalentFlux V2 â€“ AI-Native HR Platform

## Core Philosophy
- AI-first: Every action is routed through an omnipresent assistant
- Modular: All components (widgets, panels, pages) are plug-and-play
- Minimalist UI: Clean layout, subtle animations, glyph-morphism
- Dynamic routing based on user type: Employer or Candidate
- Assistant is the main control surface (MagicStar FAB)

## First User Flow
1. User visits landing page
2. Logs in (email or LinkedIn)
3. Fills onboarding form (user type: employer/candidate)
4. Redirects to role-based dashboard
5. Assistant (MagicStar FAB) is present on every screen
